### ðŸ“Š What I Have Done:
- **Created a 3D Animated Graph**: Developed a 360Â° rotating 3D graph to visualize complex data from every angle.
- **Customized Visualization**: Applied various styling techniques, including color maps and custom pane settings, to enhance visual clarity.
- **Generated GIF**: Created a smooth, high-quality GIF from a sequence of images for dynamic presentation.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- **Rotating 3D Graph**: The animation provides a full view of the data, helping to reveal patterns and trends.
- **Custom Styling**: Features clean, modern aesthetics with tailored colors and grid settings.
- **High-Quality Output**: The GIF is optimized for smooth playback and visual impact.
